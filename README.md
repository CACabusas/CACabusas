## greetings

in my free time, i play games</br>
at night, i doomscroll/watch YouTube

i usually do webdev stuff</br>
but the only project that i've actually finished and published here in GitHub is [MVFM](https://github.com/CACabusas/MVFM)

i ain't gonna sugarcoat it: the coding language i know is ChatGPT/DeepSeek lmao
(i kneel to the AI overlords)
