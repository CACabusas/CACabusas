**hallo**

i usually do video editing stuff,\
but i also do webdev stuff sometimes

i ain't gonna sugarcoat it: the coding language i know is ChatGPT/DeepSeek lmao\
but because of that, i can pretty much handle a project solo\
(i am grateful to the AI overlords)

kidding aside, below are the languages i am knowledgeable/familiar with
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Java
- Python
- SQL (MySQL)

you can check my github pages for my portfolio
